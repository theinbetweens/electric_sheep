    :desc => 'Dystopian future where replicants walk amoungst us',
    :version => '1',
    :authorEmail => 'Bob <bob@example.com>'
  )

  first_room = ElectricSheep::Room.new('Starting Room')
  first_room.desc = %q{This is the boring starting rooms.}

  me = ElectricSheep::Actor.new('me')
  me.location = first_room

  game.rooms << first_room
  game.actors << me

  puts game.build_tads
